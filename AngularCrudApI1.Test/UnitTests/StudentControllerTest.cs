            /*Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory is a package in the Entity Framework Core (EF Core) ecosystem provided by 
             * Microsoft. It's used for testing and development scenarios where you want to use an in-memory database instead of
             * a traditional database engine like SQL Server, SQLite, etc.
            When you're developing an application that uses EF Core for data access,
            you typically work with a database like SQL Server or SQLite. However,
            during development and testing, you may not want to interact with a real 
            database for various reasons (speed, isolation, etc.). In such cases, you can use
            an in-memory database provided by Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory.*/
